# Art Education
This project is to give the user a chance to learn about artworks in the Cooper-Hewitt collections. The Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, located in New York City, is the only museum in the nation devoted exclusively to historic and contemporary design. It is the mission of Cooper-Hewitt’s staff and board of trustees to advance the public understanding of design across the 240 years of human creativity represented by the museum’s collection. For more information on the museum: https://siarchives.si.edu/history/cooper-hewitt-national-design-museum

The user comes to a landing page with a placeholder image of a Cooper-Hewitt museum exhibit and a list of artworks containing cards with basic information about the piece (title, medium). The list has two states, one that shows all the artworks available and another that will show all artworks the user has 'liked.' THe user can click the heart on an art card to add it to the 'likes' state. The user can click on an image to access more detailed information about the piece (description, if available, and credit) and the placeholder image will be replaced with a larger, detailed art card.

## This app is built with React, Node, Express, and utilizes the Cooper-Hewitt API.
